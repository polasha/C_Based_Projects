# C_Based_Projects
This project task is given below one by one:


#1: Implement function with prototype ‚Äúdouble calc_pow(unsigned int n);‚Äù
that takes as input ùëõ and returns (without using pow or similar functions) 2 raised to the power ùëõ
(2ùëõ, for example 24 = 2 ‚àó 2 ‚àó 2 ‚àó 2 = 16). Use while loop to calculate the result. Use double data type
for your calculations. Handle also ùëõ = 0. Call the function calc_pow from main function with arguments 4, 1023, and 1025.
a) Verify that calc_pow(4) is indeed 16 (the correct answer)
b) Display the result to calc_pow(1023). Confirm that its correct. Hint: use %g for displaying
double for more practical output.
c) What is the result of calc_pow(1025)? Explain with details what has happened? What is this
behaviour called? What would happen with integer datatypes in similar situation?

a. Answer:

I have mentioned here code for calc_pow (4) with detailed comments in every line. We just put
the function prototype because the calc_pow() are behind the main function body. That is why
first I need to introduce the clac_pow () function as a prototype. When I called the function I got
the correct result as I observed. The output screenshot is attached below. Here, I have used two
integer variables namely mult and result , but it should be double, I have checked using double, and I
got the same answer. Because the input value is 4 , so small , that is why it does not make any
difference. But It will be different for questions b and c. Otherwise; we will not get correct answers for b
and c.



b. Answer:

Here , I have made clear comments in the code scripts for every line. Everything is almost the
same as 1 (a) but I have declared all variables as a double to get the correct answer because
there are too big numbers like 1023. After calling the calc_pow (1023) ,I got the correct output
and I checked it. 


c. Answer:

When I called calc_pow(1025), it showed the output infinity. For the double types, this behavior
is known as undefined (overflow). Overflow occurs when the number is too large. It represents
infinity. The details in terms of coding are attached with clear comments here.

Then I put the integer data types instead of doubles I got this kind of output Like 0. It represents
the under flow . it occurs when data is too small to represent. It represents 0.


#2: What is the difference between logical and bitwise operations?

Answer:

The difference between logical and bitwise operation is that logical operation makes decisions
based on the multiple operation of ground truth value while bitwise operation works on bits andperforms bit by bit. Such as , for logical operator for And logic is, 0 && 5 = False , and for 5 || 5 =
true. On the other hand, bitwise operations first need to convert in binary numbers for both
values like 5 and 5, then need to make operations between bit to bit. This calculation is given in
detail in question a and b.

a) Calculate by hand (show the calculations in the report) and by C code bitwise AND between
decimal numbers 14 and 5.

Answer:
Here : 14 = 1 1 1 0
5 = 0 1 0 1
14 & 5 = 0 1 0 0
Then, the result is , 14 & 5 = 4.
Here , c code has attached here.

b) What is logical AND between 14 and 5?

Answer:
 
For logical operation , it works with truth value.Here, 14 and 5 is the truth value and we can consider it 1. So two truth values and logical
operation should be true.
14 && 5 = true. And c code true presents as 1.
C_code has attached in this repo wit clear comments.

#3: Explain in your report step by step why 10+4%5*3/5 is exactly 12.

Answer:

According to the operator precedence and associativity,
The priority is in the following way: %, *, /, and +.
So , 10 + 4% 5 * 3 /5
=10 + 4*3/5
= 10 + 12/5
= 10 + 2 (it takes 2 in code)
= 12 
When I calculated step by step by hand according to the operator precedence and associativity
rules, I got the answer 12. And When I made the c code for this , I observed the result with 12 also.
